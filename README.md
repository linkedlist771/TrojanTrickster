# TrojanTrickster
TrojanTrickster is a pioneering project aimed at undermining malicious Trojan websites by employing the Scrapy framework to deliver non-harmful but ineffective data. This initiative serves as both a research tool and a defensive mechanism to analyze and impede the operations of harmful web entities.
